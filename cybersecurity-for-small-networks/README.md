# Cybersecurity for Small Networks â€“ Home Lab Projects

I am documenting the projects I work through from the book **_Cybersecurity for Small Networks_ by Seth Enoka**. These projects ultimately lead to a defense-in-depth architecture for a small network home lab with tools and techniques smililar to a larger, enterprise network.
