# Cybersecurity for Small Networks â€“ Homelab Projects
<!--
This repository documents my hands-on labs and configurations from working through the book **_Cybersecurity for Small Networks_ by Seth Enoka** (No Starch Press, 2022). These labs simulate real-world small-office/home-office (SOHO) environments and are designed to develop practical network defense skills.
